# euphros Front-End web development stack v0.2

## This is an open source web development front-end stack.

### How to use it
- Just go for a quick npm install (i recommend using yarn since it's what i am using so yarn install) once it's cloned.
- For now it only use node-sass as it is focused on building only the front-end of landing pages or micro-site.
- To run the compiling script just use: npm run compile (this can be edited in the package.json to suit your needs).
- The styleguide.html file is the file where you can see a basic styleguide of the components already pre-built.
- Set up your variables in the _vars.scss file to suit your needs.
- I recommand not touching the lib folder unless you know what you are doing, there is a load of pretty useful mixins in here, so check it out.

### You are ready to go! (basic usage guide)
- index.html is the starting page, feel free to add more pages to the root or to create a folder for the addionnal pages.
- Your SCSS code goes basically in _ui.scss - _global.scss or _components.scss, the other files are used by the stack itself as you have probably seen.

#### That's it for the stack v0.2 for now and here is a list of the improvment i plan on adding in a near future (hopefully).

- a Gulpfile to compile JS and SCSS instead of the script in use right now.
- Pre-built JavaScript features.
- Pre-built sass/css animations.
- More variables and pre-defined class to make coding more efficient.

#### In a not so near future, and mainly if i have the time for it

- A PHP back-end and CMS
